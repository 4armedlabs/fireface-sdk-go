# Fireface

Fireface is a fictional authentication service used in 4ARMED training labs to simulate application security flaws.

It is not intended for use outside 4ARMED and is public only to facilitate easier installation into internal systems.

It intentionally borrows from well known authentication services in its approaches to provide realistic scenarios without requiring a dependency on a third-party product.
